        My first programming starts with a simple python script like
        BMI calculator, then I decided to starts to create a game using
        Unity which then forces me to learn C#. My first game is now available
        on Google Play and is named <span onclick="change_page_googleplay()" class = 'highlight'>Cube Zoyt</span>

        <br></br>

        Finished making games, I decided that I want to make a mobile application
        using Flutter which then requires me to learn Dart. Believe it or not, my 
        mobile application that I decided to make is a social network called <span class="highlight">Vision</span>.
        The point is I want to learn the hardest thing so that even if I failed I still
        made tremendous progress but in reality, I actually succeded. In order
        to make this happen I actually learn SQL for the database and NodeJs for the 
        REST API. In the end, the apps works perfectly with it's own algorithm but I just can't
        launch it due to me not having the knowledge about social security and didn't have money to 
        maintain a domain and server 
        
        <br></br>
        
        Then I decided that I want to make a simple offline app that stores my study notes
        because personally it's really frustrating to bring a book anywhere with it being
        so big so I just compressed it into a single app. This app is known as <span onclick="change_page_googleplay()" class="highlight">Tataweb</span> and 
        is available on Google Play

        <br></br>

        At the same time, I was 
        helping my brother with his university project that uses Arduino which uses
        the C++ language

        <br></br>

        I also have made simple machine learning in Python using linear regression algorithm
        but not really deep into it. My <span class="highlight">current project</span> is AAA quality games using Unreal Engine which is based
        of Malay history in the Malacca straits
